An asthma detection and management mobile application that predicts asthma attacks using machine learning algorithms trained on collected environmental data and biosignal and sensory data extracted and processed from smartwatches. 
AsthmaGuard encompasses native iOS mobile development using Swift and SwiftUI, database management with SQL, the utilisation of APIs for web data extraction, extraction of dynamic data from smartwatches using embedded systems and internet of things concepts, and using Python for the machine learning prediction and data science feature engineering. 
AsthmaGuard is a comprehensive solution aiming to predict asthma attacks by continuously monitoring vital signs crucial for asthmatic patients' health assessment and relevant data such as weather data, medical history, and previous triggers of asthma attacks. 
AsthmaGuard is designed to assist asthmatic patients, by providing personalized asthma risk assessments, insights into triggers, and timely alerts, enhancing proactive asthma management.
