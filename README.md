AsthmaGuard: Asthma Prediction and Management System
AsthmaGuard is an innovative asthma detection and management mobile application aimed at improving the quality of life for asthmatic patients. Using a custom algorithm, AsthmaGuard processes environmental data, biosignals, and vital signs collected from smartwatches to provide personalized asthma risk assessments, insights into triggers, and timely alerts for proactive asthma management.

Key Features
Custom Algorithm for Prediction: Developed specifically to analyze environmental and biosignal data to predict asthma attacks.
Smartwatch Integration: Processes vital signs such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen levels from smartwatches, using embedded systems and IoT concepts.
Survey-Based Environmental Monitoring: Collects environmental information, including data on potential asthma triggers like pollen and air quality, through user surveys.
Personalized Risk Assessment: Provides users with tailored risk assessments and insights into asthma triggers for proactive health management.
Real-Time Alerts: Sends timely alerts based on significant changes in health or environmental conditions.
Technologies Used
iOS Development: Built using Swift and SwiftUI for a smooth and native mobile user experience.
Database Management: Uses SQLite for efficient storage and retrieval of user and health data.
APIs and IoT: Utilizes Appleâ€™s HealthKit, WatchKit, and WeatherKit for collecting vital signs and environmental information dynamically.
